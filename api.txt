Djoser Default Endpoints:

http://<your-domain>/auth/: This base URL will give you access to the various user-related 
actions such as registration, password reset, etc. Depending on your settings, 
you might not see a user-friendly interface, as these endpoints are usually used for 
API requests via clients like Postman or JavaScript frontends.
Example URLs (using localhost as an example):

User Registration: http://localhost:8000/api/auth/users/
Login (JWT): http://localhost:8000/api/auth/jwt/create/
Token Refresh: http://localhost:8000/api/auth/jwt/refresh/
Token Verify: http://localhost:8000/api/auth/jwt/verify/
Custom Logout Route:

For the LogoutView you have manually added:
http://localhost:8000/auth/logout/: This URL will trigger the LogoutView. 
It is also usually meant for API requests, so it might not render a user interface but rather return 
a JSON response (such as a logout success message).
